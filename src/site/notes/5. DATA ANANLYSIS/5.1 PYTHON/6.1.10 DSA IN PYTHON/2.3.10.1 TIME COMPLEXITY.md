#DSA 
- Code is measured thorough **TIME & SPACE** 
- That is - **TIME & MEMORY** Required/Taken to RUN. 
***
- The Big O notation is written as **`O(f(n))`**
	- Where, **`f(n)`** is a function that represents the relationship between the input size **`(n)`** and the algorithm's *runtime or resource usage.*
***
# 1. CONSTANT TIME
- *The Algorithm that will run under the* **SAME TIME & SPACE irrespective of the SIZE OF INPUT.** 
- **The Time Complexity of Constant time is** **`O(1)`**
	- Example  - **`Dictionary`** 
	- *The Key is the directly pointing to the it's Value  & doesn't require any iteration to find it.*
```Python
def access_ele(arr, i)
	return arr[i]
```
***
***
# 2. LINEAR TIME
- *The* **GREATER** *the* **RANGE,** *the* **GREATER** *the* **RUNNING TIME**.
	- *i.e. If the input is double, the runtime gets double.*
- **The Time Complexity of Linear time is** **`O(n)`**
```Python
def linear_search(arr, target):
	for item in arr:
		if item == target:
			return True
	return False
```
***
***
# 3. LOGARITHMIC TIME
- It refers to the **INPUT** against the **NUMBER OF OPERATION**
	- Using **BINARY SEARCH** *will take less number of operation & time than* **LINEAR SEARCH.**
- Logarithmic time complexity is considered **very efficient.**
- **The Time Complexity of Logarithmic time is** **`O(log n)`**
***
***
# 4. QUADRATIC TIME 
- It refers that *the runtime grow with SQUARE of the input size*. 
	- i.e. the input increases, the runtime increase **QUDRATICALLY**.
-  **The Time Complexity of Quadratic time is** **`O(n^2)`**
- Works on the NESTED LIST/LOOPs.
```Python 
for x in range(10): #Runs 10 times
	for y in range(10):  #Runs 10 times
		print(x,y) #Iterates 100 times (i.e. 10*10 = 100)
```
***
***
# 5. EXPONENTIAL TIME
- An algorithm that doubles with each iteration.
***
***
# SPEED (FAST to SLOW)
