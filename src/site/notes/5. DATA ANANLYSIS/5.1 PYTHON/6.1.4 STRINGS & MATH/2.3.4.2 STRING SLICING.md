#python 
The String Slicing has 2 methods 
	- **indexing()**
	- **slice()**
***
# indexing()
- Basically it just slice down the string of the main variable into a character or a partial string by **creating a new variable i.e substring & by indexing the characters.**
- It can be represented as - 
```Python
start:stop:step
```
***
## Example -
```Python
name = "Drake Sounds"
first_name = name [:5] 
last_name  = name [5:12]
step_name = name [:12:3]
reversed_name = name [::-1] #[0:end:-1] 
print(first_name)
print(last_name) 
print(reversed_name)
```

- Here the there are 12 characters but as we count from zero it's 11.
- So, we mention a indexing in the form of  **inclusive & exclusive form meaning that adding one count more.** 
- **STEP** is the **increment of the index** between starting & stopping.
- It's 1 by default 
- It prints step index  (such as 3; so every third char incl. first char) character including the first character.
***
***
# slice() 
- With slice function we can create an object which can be reusable.
- Here is also the **{start,stop,step}**
***
## Example -
```Python
website = "http:\\www.google.com"`
slice = slice(11,-4)
print(website[slice])
```
