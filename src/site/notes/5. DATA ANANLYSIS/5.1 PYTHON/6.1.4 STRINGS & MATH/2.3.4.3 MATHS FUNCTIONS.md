#python 
-  You need to import a library called **`maths`**.
***
 There are many mathematical functions to use. Some of them are as follows : -
- `print(round())`  - To round up the value.
- `print(math.ceil())` - To round up a value.
- `print(math.floor())` - To again round down a value.
- `print(math.abs())`  - To give an absolute value.
- `print(math.pow(value/var, power_value))` - Raise to the power.
- `print(math.log( value/var, base_value))` - Find the base log.
- `print(math.sqrt())` - To give an square root of an value.
- `print(max(x,y))` - To give the maximum value.
- `print(min(x,y)` - To give the minimum value.
