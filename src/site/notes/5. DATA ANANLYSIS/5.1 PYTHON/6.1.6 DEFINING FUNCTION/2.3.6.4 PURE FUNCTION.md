#python 
- **It doesn't change or have any effect on a variable, data, list or set beyond its own scope.** 
- That is, If you have a list on global scope, the pure function can't alter the list in any way.
***
> [!tip]
> Pure Function works well with the *Multi-Threaded Programs*; 
> *As Multi-Threaded Programs  try to run more than one process concurrently, which creates many threads of data*.

## NORMAL FUNC TO PURE FUNC 
```Python
def add_ele_to_list(lst, item):
    new_list = lst.copy()
    new_list.append(item)
    return new_list
    
nl = add_ele_to_list(my_list,4)

print("Original list - ",my_list)
print("New list - ", nl)

#Output
Original list -  [1, 2, 3]
New list -  [1, 2, 3, 4]
```
