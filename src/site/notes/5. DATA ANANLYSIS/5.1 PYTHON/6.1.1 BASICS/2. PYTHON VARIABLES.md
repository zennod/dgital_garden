# VARIABLES
## Variables names are case sensitive in Python 
- For Ex -  `name & NAME` , these both are the different variables.
	- Must start with a letter or an underscore.
	- Can have numbers but can't start with a numerical value.
## Example - 
```Python
name = input("What's your name").strip().title()
```

> [!NOTE]
>  Here, **"name"** is a variable.

## GLOBAL SCOPE VARIABLE

## LOCAL SCOPE VARIABLE 
- Can be access *within a certain block of function/scope.*
## ENCLOSING SCOPE VARIABLE 
- Can be accessed *within the in the function & also in the nested functions.*
- Can't be accessed globally.
## BUILT-IN SCOPE VARIABLE 
- It refers to the built-in keyword known as **RESERVED KEYWORDs** *(such as **`def`**,**`print`**, etc)*
- Can be accessible **GLOBALLY & LOCALLY**
