#python 
- We can ***WRITE*** a file in Python.
- ==***First, Ensure that the file must present in the same directory as of your coding directory.***==
- We can also ***write on a file which doesn't exists***. So to do so, just follow up.
***
- To know the ***HANDLE's information*** you can use:-

# CREATING A FILE
- You can create a file by using the **`write`** mode.
```Python
with open(<file_name>,'w') as file:
	file.write("Content to be added")
```
- To Write multiple number of lines; Use **`writelines()`** function.
- **`writelines()`** accepts a **`list[]`** 
```Python
with open(<file_name>,'w') as file:
	file.writelines(["Content to be added","\nAnother Line"])
```

## EXAMPLE

***
- To encounter the ***overwriting of text*** in WRITE mode, ***change the WRITE mode to APPEND mode.***

## EXAMPLE
```Python 
def create_append_file():
    try:
        with open("text.txt",'a') as file:
            file.writelines(["\nFirst Line","\nSecond line","\nThird Line"])
    except FileNotFoundError as e:
        print("ERROR",e)
```
#### To work with LARGER FILES you can iterate it. As shown below:-
