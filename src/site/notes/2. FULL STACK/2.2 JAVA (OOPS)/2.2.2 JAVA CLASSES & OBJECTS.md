# Introduction
**Classes and Objects was introduced to solve the real-world problems by coding or programming.**
### For Ex - 
- *Blueprint of the CAR* = **CLASS**.
- *Each Manufactured CAR* = **OBJECT**. 
***
1. A **DATA MEMBER** may be of any type, including **classes already defined, pointers to objects of any type, or even references to objects of any type**.
{ #dataMember}

2. **MEMBER FUNCTIONS** are **operators and functions** that are declared as members of a class.
{ #memberFunction}

***
# CLASS
- ***It is is a user-defined data type which defines its properties and its functions.***
- Class consist of **DATA MEMBERS** & **MEMBER FUNCTIONS**.
- **Class is the only logical representation of the data**
- Class name should always **start** with **Capital Letter**. 
	- Ex - **`class College{ }`**
- The class does not occupy any memory space till the time an object is instantiated.
- ***Functions defined in CLASS are called as*** **METHODS**
### For Ex - 
- *Human being is a* **class.**
- *The body parts of a human being are its* **properties**
- *The actions performed by the body parts are known as* **functions**
***
# OBJECT
- **It is an INSTANCE OF THE CLASS**
- *An object can operate on both* **data members** *and* **member functions.**

> [!NOTE]+ Note
> **The OBJECT is created using a **`new`** keyword** in *Java*

***
## Syntax
### In main source file 
**`Class_name Class_var = new class_constuctor_name()`**

### For Ex - 
**`Student s1 = new student();`**

# Defining Classes

1. *First a* **CLASS** *should be made separately in a different* **PACKAGE** *folder*.
	- There can be *'n'* number of **PACKAGES** with **DIFFERENT CLASSES**.
2. Secondly, You need to **IMPORT** the **PACKAGE** using **`import package_name.Class_name`**

3. Then,  **CREATE A OBJECT USING `new` KEYWORD** *& write the code according to the requirement.*

# In Class Package  
> [!NOTE]+ Note
> **You should always use `this` keyword as it tells the method that which object has to access the specific property.
> & also it, refers the current instance of the class.**
