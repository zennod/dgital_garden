- It's used to **HIDE** the **IMPLEMENTION DATA**. 
- In other words, *to HIDE unnecessary details & Only show the essential parts/functionalities to the user.*
- The implementation data will be hidden in child class.
***
## The Abstraction can be carried through in 2 ways: - 
# 1. ABSTRACT CLASS (PARTIAL-ABSTRACTION)
1. It's can declared by using **ABSTRACT** keyword.
2. You can't Create the **OBJECT** of an **ABSTRACT CLASS**.
3. Can Have *MULTIPLE ABSTRACT & NON-ABSTRACT METHOD*, but If a *CLASS IS ABSTRACT CLASS*, **one ABSTRACT METHOD/FUNCTION is mandatory.**
4. It consists of 
	- **ABSTRACT FUNCTION** - *It's only declared but doesn't consists any body (defined)*.
	- **NON - ABSTRACT FUNCTION** - *It's declared & also contains body. Just like an normal function & doesn't have any* **ABSTRACT KEYWORD**
5. It can have any **Type of Variables** *(Public, Final, Static)* 
6. **ABSTRACT CLASS** is faster in performance cause it has to traverse less.
***
#### Example - 
```java
public abstract class Human {

// abstract function/method
	public abstract void walk(); //Mandatory 

// non - abstract function/method
	public void breath() {     
		System.out.println("I can breath"); 
	} 
}
```
***
> [!NOTE]+
>  *Whenever you **EXTENDS** an **ABSTRACT CLASS** *, it's*  **MANDATORY** *to* **OVER-RIDE** (meaning creating a same non-abstract method in the child class with body) *all the* **FUNCTION** *of the* **PARENT CLASS**  (i.e. ABSTRACT CLASS).

```Java
// HUMAN CLASS - Parent Class
public abstract class Human {
	public abstract void walk();
	
	public void breath() {     
		System.out.println("I can breath"); 
	} 
}
----------------------------------------------------------
// BOY CLASS - Child Class

public class Boy extends Human{
// Here, you need to again declare & define(body) the abstract function/method
	public void walk(){
	System.out.println("I can Walk"); 

// We can also have Non-overriden method
	public void talk(){
	System.out.println("I can Talk");
	}	
	}
}
----------------------------------------------------------
//Main class

//Simple object creation
Boy b1 = new Boy();
b1.walk();
b1.talk();

//Dynamic Polymorphism
Human h1 = new Boy();
h1.walk();
h1.talk();// Can't call the this Object.
```
***
***
# 2. INTERFACES (FULL-ABSTRACTION)
- Here, You can have **Only ABSTRACT METHODS** *(No body, No abstract keyword also)*, This gives us **FULL ABSTRACTION.**

- Can't create **OBJECT** of **INTERFACE**
- Since, a *CLASS CAN* **EXTEND** *A CLASS but* **INTERFACE IMPLEMENTS PARENT_CLASS**  can't.
 
- It's created using the keyword **INTERFACE**.
	- **`public interface Car`**
- So, We use the keyword **IMPLEMENTS** rather than **EXTENDS**. 
	- **`class BMW implements Car`**
- As soon as, you use implement; you need to *define(with body)* the previous defined function again which was defined in the **INTERFACE**.
***
- All the **FUNCTIONS** are **PUBLIC** & **ABSTRACT** by **DEFAULT.**
- Variables Types in interfaces are **STATIC** & **FINAL**
- A class that implements an interface must implement all the methods declared in the interface. 
- Interfaces support the functionality of multiple inheritance.
****
#### Example
```java
public interface Shape {
	public double getArea();
	public double getPeri();
}

class Circle implements Shape {
	public double getArea()
		System.out.println("The Area");
	public double getPeri()
		System.out.println("The Perimeter");

// We can also have Non-overriden method
		public void display_l_b()
			System.out.println("Display Lenght & Breath");
		
}
----------------------------------------------------------
//Main class

//Simple object creation
Circle c1 = new Circle();
c1.getArea();
c1.getPeri();
c1.display_l_b();

//Dynamic Polymorphism

Shape s1 = new Circle();
s1.getArea();
s1.getPeri();
//We can't Call the non-overriden method as Dynamic Polymorphism depends on overiding.
```
