# Platform Independence
1. It means that byte code can run on all operating system
2. We need to convert source code to machine code so computer can understand it. 
3. Compiler helps in doing this by turning it into executable code. 
4. This executable code is a set of instruction s for the computer 
5. After compiling C/C++ code we get .exe file which is platform dependent. 
6. In java we get byte code, JVM(Platform dependent) converts this to machine code. 
7. Java is platform independent but JVM is platform dependent.
