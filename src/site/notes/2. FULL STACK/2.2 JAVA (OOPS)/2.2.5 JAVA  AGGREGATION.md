#java 
# Aggregation
- *Object of* **ONE CLASS** *is used as an* **DATA MEMBER** *of* **ANOTHER CLASS.**
- Also, **It'sÂ a relationship between two classes that is best described as a "has-a" relationship**
## Example - 
### In Student Class File
- Consider, we have an **STUDENT CLASS**; in which we have *3 Data Member* 
```java
public class Student{
	int rno;
	String name;
	Address add;
	}
```
- Here, the **`Address`** is what we call as **AGGREGATION.**
- The **ADDRESS** is a **NEW CLASS** file that we'll use in **ANOTHER CLASS**
***
### Taking the above example - Student Class
- We'll be using **`Address`** Class Constructor as an **OBJECT** in **`Student`** Class.
```java
public Student(){
	this.rno = 22;
	this.name = "abc";
	this.address = new Address();
	}
```

```java
public Student(int r, String name, Address add){
	this.rno = r;
	this.name = n;
	this.address = add;
}
```

***
***
### In Main File
1. You need to import the **`address`** class
2. Then, Create an object of **`address`** using **`new`** keyword.
