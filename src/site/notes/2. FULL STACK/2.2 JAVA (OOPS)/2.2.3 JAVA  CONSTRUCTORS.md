#java 
# SPECIAL FUNCTION
**`Student s1 = new Student()`**
- As soon as the **`new`** keyword is used, *the object gets allocated in the memory heap.*
- Now, **`Student()`**, *the parenthesis refers to a function in programming*. So, this is also a function in **JAVA** but a **SPECIAL FUNCTION** called as **CONSTRUCTORS**.
***
- ***Java Constructors constructs Java Objects.***
- Java Constructors is used to **initialize an object** (*i.e. To initialize data member of new objects*)
***
## Special  Member Function
1. **Constructors have the same name as class**
2. **Constructors donâ€™t have a return type. (Not even void)**
3. **Constructors are only called ONCE, at object creation.**

## Parameterized Constructor
- A constructor which **has one or more PARAMETERs** is known as **Parameterized Constructor.**
```java
Student(int r, String n){
	rno = r;
	name = n;
}

// Calling the constructor in main file
Student s2 = new.Student(11,"MSi");
```
