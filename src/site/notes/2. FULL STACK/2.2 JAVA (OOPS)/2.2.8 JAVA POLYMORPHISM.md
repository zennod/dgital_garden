- *Polymorphism means* **SAME NAME FUNCTIONs** *with* **DIFFERENT FORMS**.
***
## There are 2 Types of Polymorphism : -
# 1. STATIC POLYMORPHISM
- Also known as **COMPILE TIME POLYMORPHISM** *&* **FUNCTION OVERLOADING**.
- It doesn't depend on the **RETURN TYPE**.
***
### FUNCTION OVERLOADING
- It's a technique which allows to have **MORE THAN ONE FUNCTION** with **SAME NAME** in the **SAME CLASS** but it should *DIFFER* in **PARAMETER TYPE** & **NUMBER OF PARAMETER**.

#### Example : - 
```java
 public void displayInfo(String name) {
 System.out.println(name);
 }

public void displayInfo(int age) {
 System.out.println(age);
}

public void displayInfo(String name, int age) {
System.out.println(name);
System.out.println(age);
 }

// Order of the type can be differ
void sum(int a, String b){
}

void sum (String b, int a) {
}
```
***
***
# 2. DYNAMIC POLYMORPHISM (TOP - CASTING)
- Also known as **RUNTIME POLYMORPHISM** & **FUNCTION OVER-RIDING.** Also , called **LATE BINDING**
- Final Keyword is used to create **CONSTANTS**
- You can't over-ride a method which is **`final`**. 
	- **`final void area()`**
***
### FUNCTION OVER-RIDING
- It's a technique used to **OVER-RIDE** the **CHILD CLASS** over the **METHOD/FUNCTION** of the **PARENT CLASS**.
- The **OVER-RIDING** is carried out if this parameters exists: -
	1. If there exists 2 or more function with **SAME NAME & SAME SIGNATURE** (*i.e. Return type, parameters & Every Other Thing same*) in **BOTH CHILD & PARENT CLASS**
	2. Then, Create a **OBJECT** of **CHILD CLASS** in main & call the **CHILD FUNCTION**.
	3. Lastly, the **CHILD FUNCTION** *will OVER-RIDE the* **PARENT FUNCTION**.(*Meaning - It'll process the CHILD FUNCTION first then the PARENT FUNCTION.*)
***
```Java
// General form
Parent_class var_name = new Child_class // TOP-CASTING
// or 
Parent_class var_name = new Parent_class

// NOT ALLOWED
Child_class var_name = new Parent_class
```
***
### Example (OBJECT OF PARENT CLASS)
```java
Dog dog_P = new Dog();
dog_p.dogfeature();
```
- Making parent object and pointing to the parent class. Here the method / function(which has same signature) of parent class will be called.
***
### Example (OBJECT OF CHILD CLASS)
```Java
Dog dog_C = new Labrador();
dog_c.dogfeature();
```
- making child object and pointing to the parent class. Here the method/ function (which has same signature) of child will be called.
***
### Example 
```JAVA
class Car{
	public void start(){
	 sout("Car-Start")
	};

	public void stop(){
	sout("Car-Stop")
	};
}
----------------------------------------------------------
// Child Class

class Nissan extends Car{
	@Override            //overriden method
	public void start(){ 
	 sout("Nissan-Start")
	};

	// non-overriden method
	public void gt_edition(){
	sout("Has A GT Edition")
	};
}
----------------------------------------------------------
// Main file
// Dynamic Polymorphism (Can access Overriden & Common methods)
Car c1 = new Nissan();
c1.start(); // Output - Nissan-Start [Calls the Child class method]
c1.stop(); //Output - Car-Stop [Calls the Parent class method]
c1.gt_edition() //Output - Error [Can't call the child method from parent object]

```

***
> [!NOTE]+ 
You can't **CALL** the **CHILD FUNCTION** *by using* **PARENT OBJECT**

***
# DYNAMIC METHOD DISPATCH
- It's a mechanism by which a call to an overridden method is resolve (decide) at run-time rather than compile time
- The Java will decide which method to execute at run-time
- Java determines which version of method to be called based on the type of the object
