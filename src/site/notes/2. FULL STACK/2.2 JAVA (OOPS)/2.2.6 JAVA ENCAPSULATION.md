# ACCESS SPECIFIERs
- *Encapsulation is carried out by* **ACCESS SPECIFIERs**.
	- There are *3 types of ACCESS SPECIFIERS.*
		1. **PUBLIC** - Only Accessible **ANYWHERE**.
		2. **PRIVATE** - Not Accessible in the **PRESENT FILE** **(WITHIN THE CLASS FILE)**
		3. **DEFAULT** - Only Accessible in **PACKAGE FOLDER**
		4. **PROTECTED** - Allows access with the **SAME CLASS**, **SUBCLASS** & in **PACKAGE FOLDER**.

## CLASS-LEVEL ENCAPSULATION
- In Java, A single class file may have **MULTIPLE CLASS** but only one of them can have **PUBLIC ACCESS SPECIFIER**.
- And, Also the **NAME** of the **PUBLIC CLASS** will be the name of the **CLASS FILE**.
- At Class Level Encapsulation, 
	- The **DATA MEMBER** will be **PRIVATE**
	- The **MEMBER FUNCTION** will be **PUBLIC**
